  <p align="left">
    It's been said that automating oneself out of a job is one of the best qualities of a software engineer. When it comes to building and releasing software that statement becomes more relevant than ever. GitHub is a popular choice for hosting code and since a few years ago offers a native CI/CD solution: GitHub Actions. They are a powerful tool that's worth adding to your development toolbox but getting started might be a bit daunting. In this session we'll cover the basics of working with GitHub Actions workflows and their structure, moving into more advanced topics such as inputs/outputs, job dependencies, job matrices, reusable workflows, composite actions, and secrets.
